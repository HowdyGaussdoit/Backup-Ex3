Initial Post: Based on the Chapter 3 reading and activities, explain what classes and objects are in object-oriented programming. Also give an example of each and explain how they work together in a computer program. (Due October 2nd)

Peer Review Post: Read and reply to a peer's forum post - contribute additional detail, examples, questions, etc. 

3.5 - A default constructor does not initialize the class's fundamental type data members,
      but does call the default constructor for each data member that's an object of another class. 
      In any class that does not explicitly define a constructor, the compiler provides a default constructor with no parameters.


3.6 - A class's data members maintain data for each object of the class. A member function can call this value stored in a data member,
    as get and set member functions can manipulate the value stored in the data member.
    private:
        std::string name;

3.7 - class <string> is also part of the <iostream> class and can be included in the driver. In main, std::string is called, then std::cout 
      with a return statement. Without declaring a using directive in main, this can be done.

3.8 - A data member may call the set name function to store the data in the data member object. The get function calls the data from the 
      hidden data member object's data used by the set function.
